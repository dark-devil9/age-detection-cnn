# ðŸ§  Age Detection Using Deep Learning

This project predicts a personâ€™s age based on their facial image using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). It includes training the model on the UTKFace dataset and deploying it in a real-time webcam-based application.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- Predicts age from facial images using CNN
- Trained on the UTKFace dataset (20K+ images)
- Real-time age detection via webcam using OpenCV
- Age range classification for clearer output (e.g., "10â€“20", "28â€“45")

## ðŸ–¼ Dataset

- **Name:** [UTKFace Dataset](https://susanqq.github.io/UTKFace/)
- **Size:** ~20,000 facial images
- **Labels:** Age (0â€“116), Gender, Ethnicity (only Age used here)
- **Format:** `age_gender_ethnicity_date.jpg` (age is extracted from the filename)

## ðŸ§ª Model Architecture

The model is a CNN built with TensorFlow/Keras:
